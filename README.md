# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe project! This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game allows two players to play against each other or against a computer opponent.


## Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet fun game for two players, `X` and `O`, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- Two-player mode
- Player vs. Computer mode
- Interactive command-line interface (or GUI, if applicable)
- Clear and concise game board display
- Input validation and error handling

## Game Rules

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. Player 1 is `X`, and Player 2 (or the computer) is `O`. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. If all 9 squares are full and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
